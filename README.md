2015-03-26 Switch to GitHub and Restart of Development

The basis of this repository is the oryx-editor project as hosted on google-code 
before. As the project has been abondoned some years ago (due to the makers going 
commercial) and Google-Code is going to be discontinued anyway, we imported the 
code-base (tag: "google-code-version") to GitHub and will attempt to further 
develop the project here.
